Runescape Woodcutting Bot

Description/Purpose: This project is a automatic functioning bot for a MMORPG called Runescape. This bot focuses on the skill woodcutting.
It allows you to select a certain type of tree you would like to cut down and off it goes cutting and banking for you. The purpose of this
project was to do something I always wanted to do and that was creating a bot. As a kid I would use programs like this to play the game
and always wanted to make one so I finally did.

Dependencies: Tribot-loader jar file, Tribot jar file, and Tribot VIP membership to run a local bot on the loader

Usage: The use of this project is for someone who wants to train the skill woodcutting but do not have the time to or do not want to.

Future work: I can upgrade a lot about this code. There are a lot more functions within the api I used to increase the human like actions
of the bot (like clicking random places, opening differnet screen, etc.) to better protect the user from being banned, add more option to
the GUI and code itself (more locations), and a way to check if you have the requirements to cut a tree(axe in the inventory and level to
cut the tree)

This project consists of 100% java language and is the main language Ihave used throughout my coding career.
